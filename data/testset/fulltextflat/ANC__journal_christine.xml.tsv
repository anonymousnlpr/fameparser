195	23936	1	1	0	4112786	Kofi Annan , the Secretary-General of the United Nations , recently called attention to the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the United Nations and the world scientific community closer to each other ( Annan 2003 ) .	null	null	null	null	UNANN	6573014	null	null	null	null
195	23936	2	1	0	4112787	Mr . Annan stressed the importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing countries , asserting that “This unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries , but for development itself . ” Indeed , Mr . Annan 's sentiments have also been echoed recently by several scientists , who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific output between the developing and already developed countries ( Gibbs 1995 ; May 1997 ; Goldemberg 1998 ; Riddoch 2000 ) .	null	null	null	null	UNANN	6573015	null	null	null	null
195	23936	3	1	0	4112788	For example , recent United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) estimates ( UNESCO 2001 ) indicate that , in 1997 , the developed countries accounted for some 84% of the global investment in scientific research and development , had approximately 72% of the world researchers , and produced approximately 88% of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) .	null	null	null	null	UNANN	6573016	null	null	null	null
195	23936	4	1	0	4112789	North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications produced annually , with 36.6% and 37.5% , respectively , worldwide ( UNESCO 2001 ) .	null	null	null	null	UNANN	6573017	null	null	null	null

195	23936	1	3	0	4112791	It is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science and therefore account for the largest number of publications .	null	null	null	null	UNANN	6573019	null	null	null	null
195	23936	2	3	0	4112792	It is also likely that there is a statistical bias on the part of the SCI as a bibliometric database , since it represents North American and European publications far better than those of the rest of the world ( Gibbs 1995 ; May 1997 ; Alonso and Fernández-Juricic 2001 ; Vohora and Vohora 2001 ) .	null	null	null	null	UNANN	6573020	null	null	null	null
